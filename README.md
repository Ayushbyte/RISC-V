# RISC-V Simulation Using Logisim
This project implements a RISC-V 32 bit (Reduced Instruction Set Computer Vth Generation) using the simulation engine [Logisim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/). Follow the steps below to get started with the simulation.

# Getting Started
1. **Download the .circ File:**
The .circ file contains the RISC-V implementation. Download the file from this repository and open it using Logisim.

2. **Explore the Modules:**
On the left-hand side of Logisim, you'll find multiple modules. The main module to focus on is "datapath".

3. **Simulate and Implement Instructions:**
- Click on the datapath module.
- Switch to Simulating Hierarchy mode.
- Change the "Ins" to implement your custom instructions.
- To generate your own commands, visit [RISC-V Assembler](https://riscvasm.lucasteske.dev/).
- **Note:** Some basic commands are already written in the module to help you get started.

4. **Perform Arithmetic Operations:**
- Navigate to the register module to perform arithmetic operations using the registers.
- Modify the register values according to your specifications.
- Tick the clock once to observe the results.
